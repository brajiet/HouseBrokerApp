This is web application built using ASP.NET Core, .NET 8, 
and a few essential libraries like Entity Framework Core, AutoMapper, 
and Identity. 
Additionally, I've implemented RESTful APIs within the application using ASP.NET Core's built-in support for web APIs.
Leveraging ASP.NET Core's powerful routing and controller features,
I was able to define endpoints for performing CRUD operations on various resources.
By adhering to RESTful principles, I ensured that the APIs are easy to understand, predictable, and scalable. 
These APIs enable seamless interaction with the application, allowing clients to retrieve, create, update, and 
delete data through standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 
I have used Swagger for documenting, testing, and interacting with APIs. 

It uses MSSQL Server for stroing and retrieving data.
